# aws-network-firewall-poc

This repository contains the code to deploy an AWS Network Firewall behind a NAT gateway using CloudFormation.

### Sources
This project is based on the [AWS Network Firewall Workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/networkfirewall/en-US) decentralised use case. We have modified it to have the Firewall Endpoint downstream the NAT gateway.
To perform this modification, we followed the steps outlined in the [AWS Knowledge Center guide](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/network-firewall-set-up-with-nat-gateway).
